- View live execution logs, visible agent responses, file modification events, and command outputs for the active bead
- Inspect each bead's status (pending, in progress, done, or error) and code-only diff.
- Watch automatic Ralph recovery after a failure. It appends a structured note, resets the worktree, increments the iteration, and retries within the configured budget.
