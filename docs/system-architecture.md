# System Architecture

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TL;DR** — LoopTroop is a local control plane: a React browser client talks to a Hono backend, durable state lives in SQLite plus `.ticket/**` artifacts, each ticket executes in its own git worktree, and all model work goes through OpenCode behind a session-ownership layer. On restart, the backend rebuilds runtime projections, hydrates ticket actors, and reconnects only the sessions it still owns.

This document is the canonical architecture reference for the current LoopTroop application.

LoopTroop is not a thin chat wrapper around a coding model. It is a long-running workflow system with explicit planning phases, durable storage, isolated execution worktrees, resumable ticket actors, and restart-aware OpenCode session ownership. The core architectural rule is simple: **important state must survive the model and survive the browser**.

## 1. Mental Model

LoopTroop operates as a layered local system:

1. The browser runs a React SPA plus local providers for UI state, log caching, and AI question handling.
2. A Hono API owns the REST and SSE boundary and applies auth, rate limiting, and JSON validation before requests reach workflow code.
3. XState ticket actors hold the live workflow state machine, while the workflow runner dispatches the phase-specific handlers.
4. Council orchestration and structured-output normalization turn raw model text into bounded, typed artifacts before anything becomes canonical.
5. Durable truth lives in SQLite, `.ticket/**` artifacts, runtime projections, and JSONL logs rather than in model transcripts.
6. OpenCode sessions do the model work inside isolated ticket worktrees, and Git/GitHub delivery turns the resulting change set into a PR outcome.

## 2. Runtime Actors

| Actor | Responsibility | Primary modules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser shell | App bootstrap, modal/URL coordination, dashboard vs ticket workspace switching, startup notices | `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/layout/*` |
| Browser state providers | Persistent UI state, AI question queue, and bounded per-ticket live-log overlay | `src/context/UIContext.tsx`, `src/context/AIQuestionContext.tsx`, `src/context/LogContext.tsx` |
| React Query + SSE hooks | Fetching, cache invalidation, replay recovery, startup-status fetches | `src/hooks/*`, especially `useTickets.ts`, `useTicketArtifacts.ts`, `useSSE.ts`, `useStartupStatus.ts` |
| Hono API | REST routes and SSE endpoint under `/api` | `server/index.ts`, `server/routes/*` |
| API guard rails | CORS, token auth, per-bucket rate limiting, JSON validation | `server/middleware/*` |
| Ticket state machine | Canonical ticket statuses, legal transitions, blocked-error resume rules | `server/machines/ticketMachine.ts`, `server/machines/types.ts` |
| Actor persistence and hydration | Snapshot reconciliation, safe restore, startup hydration of non-terminal tickets | `server/machines/persistence.ts`, `server/startup.ts` |
| Phase orchestrators | Planning, approval, execution, retry, cleanup, and delivery logic | `server/workflow/*`, `server/phases/*` |
| Council + structured output layer | Draft/vote/refine orchestration, tagged-output parsing, schema normalization, retry diagnostics | `server/council/*`, `server/structuredOutput/*`, `server/phases/parserTaggedStructuredOutput.ts`, `server/lib/structuredOutput*.ts` |
| OpenCode integration | Session creation, prompting, event/question translation, ownership validation, blocked-error diagnostics | `server/opencode/*` |
| SSE broadcaster + execution logging | Ticket-scoped fan-out, replay buffer, durable log ingestion, session-status log translation | `server/sse/broadcaster.ts`, `server/log/*`, `server/workflow/sessionStatusLogging.ts` |
| App database | Singleton profile, attached projects, startup UI meta | `server/db/index.ts`, `server/db/init.ts` |
| Project database + ticket storage | Tickets, artifacts, phase attempts, OpenCode sessions, error history, runtime projections | `server/db/project.ts`, `server/storage/*` |
| Git and GitHub layer | Worktrees, diffs, commits, PR creation, merge/close flows | `server/phases/execution/gitOps.ts`, `server/git/*` |
| Startup bootstrap | Database init, crash recovery, WSL/runtime diagnostics, actor hydration, session reconnect | `server/startup.ts`, `server/startupState.ts`, `server/runtime.ts` |

## 3. Authoritative Data Ownership

LoopTroop deliberately splits state across several storage layers. Each layer owns a different class of truth.

| Storage location | Canonical contents | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `~/.config/looptroop/app.sqlite` by default | Singleton profile, attached projects, app meta such as startup restore-notice dismissal | Configurable via `LOOPTROOP_CONFIG_DIR` or `LOOPTROOP_APP_DB_PATH` |
| `<project>/.looptroop/db.sqlite` | Tickets, runtime metadata, OpenCode session ownership, `phase_artifacts`, `ticket_phase_attempts`, status history, error occurrences | This is the project-local operational database |
| `<project>/.looptroop/worktrees/<ticket>/` | The isolated ticket worktree used for planning artifacts, runtime files, and code changes | Startup blocks if `.looptroop` is tracked by Git so stale runtime data cannot be checked out into new worktrees; `.ticket/**` stays local LoopTroop state and is excluded from bead commits and PR diffs |
| `.ticket/relevant-files.yaml` | Relevant-file scan output used by later planning phases | Replaces older `codebase-map.yaml` terminology |
| `.ticket/interview.yaml` and `.ticket/prd.yaml` | Editable review artifacts for the approved planning stages | These are user-facing canonical documents |
| `.ticket/beads/<flow>/.beads/issues.jsonl` | The current bead plan for a given flow or base branch | Stored as JSONL, rewritten atomically on updates |
| `.ticket/runtime/execution-log.jsonl`, `.debug.jsonl`, `.ai.jsonl` | Durable workflow, debug, and AI-detail log channels | Live rows arrive through SSE; reload/history reads use the cooperative SQLite projection and paginated `/api/tickets/:id/logs` route |
| `.ticket/runtime/state.yaml` | Derived runtime projection for the active non-terminal ticket | Rebuilt from ticket state on startup; convenient to inspect, but not the only source of truth |
| `.ticket/runtime/execution-setup-profile.json` | Concrete execution environment profile produced after approved setup runs | Separate from the reviewable execution setup plan artifact |
| `.ticket/runtime/execution-setup/**`, especially `tool-cache/` | Ticket-owned temp roots, wrapper outputs, execution-only toolchains, and reusable caches | Preserved across setup-plan rewinds when safe so retries do not throw away valid tool caches |
| `.ticket/manual-qa/**` | Versioned checklists/results/coverage, evidence binaries, generation/operation receipts, clean baselines, and workspace-drift decisions | Preserved during cleanup and excluded from bead commits, candidate diffs, and PRs |
| `phase_artifacts` table | Structured snapshots used by the API and UI | Holds artifact content, phase, attempt number, timestamps, approval receipts, edit receipts, cleanup/integration reports, and content hashes. Lightweight manifest/content endpoints are available for targeted consumers; the historical phase review keeps its established curated artifact-card presentation. |

> Note
> SQLite and the filesystem are complementary, not redundant. The database is optimized for querying, ownership, and workflow bookkeeping; `.ticket/**` keeps artifacts inspectable, editable, and recoverable without polluting the target repository branch.

### Durable State Beats Conversational Memory

The reason state is split across these layers is a deliberate design commitment: durable storage beats conversational memory. LoopTroop stores meaningful workflow state in places that can be inspected, queried, and rebuilt — SQLite, `.ticket/**` YAML and JSONL artifacts, durable execution logs, and worktree state tied to git snapshots. If the process restarts, the system recovers from storage, not from a model trying to remember what happened (see [Restart And Session Ownership](#_8-restart-and-session-ownership)).

For the per-table breakdown of which database owns what, see the [Database Schema](database-schema.md).

## 4. End-to-End Ticket Lifecycle

1. A ticket starts in `DRAFT` with editable title, description, and priority.
2. `SCANNING_RELEVANT_FILES` creates `relevant-files.yaml` from the ticket description and repo context.
3. The interview council drafts, votes, refines the interview artifact, and iterates until interview coverage is good enough.
4. The user approves the interview artifact.
5. The PRD council drafts, votes, refines, and coverage-checks the spec.
6. The user approves the PRD artifact.
7. The beads council drafts, votes, refines, expands, and coverage-checks the execution plan.
8. The user approves the beads artifact; LoopTroop drafts the pre-implementation execution setup plan in an active status, then publishes a separate copy for human review.
9. Implementation runs bead by bead in an isolated ticket worktree, with bounded retry per bead.
10. Post-implementation final testing routes either directly to integration or through the start-locked optional `GENERATING_QA_CHECKLIST → WAITING_MANUAL_QA` loop. QA failures become fix beads and return to coding/fresh tests; pass, waiver, or skip continues.
11. Integration, PR creation, review follow-up, and cleanup drive the ticket to `COMPLETED`, `CANCELED`, or `BLOCKED_ERROR`.

The full phase map lives in [Ticket Flow & State Machine](ticket-flow.md).

## 5. Planning Flow

Planning is intentionally artifact-driven.

| Stage | Primary input | Primary output | Why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery scan | Ticket details | `relevant-files.yaml` | Grounds planning in the actual codebase |
| Interview council | Ticket details, relevant files | Interview document and answer session | Forces ambiguity out before specs |
| PRD council | Ticket details, interview, relevant files, member-specific Full Answers | PRD document | Produces the feature contract |
| Beads council | Ticket details, PRD, relevant files | Execution bead plan | Converts the spec into execution units |
| Execution setup planning | Ticket details, PRD, beads, backend-detected host and Git evidence, original checkout and ticket worktree | Reviewable current-host setup plan with structured commands and approved workspace inputs | Separates the model proposal from backend-owned identity, policy, and evidence before code changes begin |

The planning phases are not one long conversation. Each stage assembles a new context window from durable artifacts and runs in its own session scope.

Councils are a reusable subsystem, not bespoke logic embedded in each phase. `server/council/pipeline.ts` handles the common draft -> quorum -> vote -> refine shape, while each phase provides its own context and normalization rules.

Structured output is a hard boundary. `server/structuredOutput/*` and `server/phases/parserTaggedStructuredOutput.ts` normalize, validate, and optionally repair model output before anything becomes canonical artifact content. Rejected or uncorrectable responses are preserved as diagnostics and raw attempts so downstream phases never consume malformed text as if it were approved state.

Human approval gates are content-addressed. The API exposes the current artifact hash for interview, PRD, beads, and execution setup plan views; approval requests must send `expectedContentSha256`; stale approvals return `409` instead of approving bytes the user did not review. Approval snapshots and receipts keep the reviewed raw content plus `content_sha256`, and interview/PRD receipts also record the post-stamp stored hash when approval metadata changes the YAML.

## 6. Execution Flow

Execution is built around beads, not around one monolithic coding prompt.

1. `PRE_FLIGHT_CHECK` verifies the ticket can enter pre-implementation setup, including worktree cleanliness before setup starts.
2. `GENERATING_EXECUTION_SETUP_PLAN` performs read-only setup-plan generation in a versioned attempt. A valid candidate and report remain in drafting history and are copied into a fresh approval attempt. Exhausted structured repairs preserve rejected output and diagnostics, then still hand off to approval; unexpected operational failures use `BLOCKED_ERROR`.
3. `WAITING_EXECUTION_SETUP_APPROVAL` pauses for review of the separate approval copy composed from the AI proposal plus backend-owned current-host, identity, policy, and hook evidence. Malformed generation disables Approve/Edit while preserving diagnostics and Regenerate.
4. `PREPARING_EXECUTION_ENV` validates and materializes approved non-reproducible workspace inputs without replacing tracked ticket source, then follows repository evidence and the approved plan without assuming a programming language, build system, or project layout. Direct processes and explicitly named POSIX, Command Prompt, or PowerShell scripts run with repository-relative working directories and structured environment data. One Execution Setup Timeout deadline covers all active work in an attempt; each genuine retry receives a fresh budget.
5. `CODING` selects the next runnable bead from the scheduler.
6. `executeBead()` starts or reattaches to the owned OpenCode session for that bead attempt.
7. The model must emit the expected structured bead status markers. Missing or malformed markers trigger a structured retry path instead of silently progressing.
8. The coding agent runs the smallest appropriate bead-scoped checks, adapting planned commands when repository evidence requires it, and returns a structured `done/pass` marker. LoopTroop validates that marker and proceeds to local finalization without independently rerunning frozen bead commands; ticket-level Final Testing remains backend executed and mandatory.
9. If the shared coding/verification deadline expires, LoopTroop appends a structured Failed Iteration Note, abandons the session, resets the worktree to the bead start commit, and retries in fresh context.
10. Only after all declared commands pass does LoopTroop finalize the bead locally. Changed work must be committed, true no-op work may complete without a commit, push failures are warnings, and fatal finalization failures append a separate ANSI-free Finalization Failure Note before routing to manual `BLOCKED_ERROR` recovery.
11. `RUNNING_FINAL_TEST`, optional Manual QA, `INTEGRATING_CHANGES`, and `CREATING_PULL_REQUEST` package the result for delivery. Git-hook inheritance supplies the initial Observe, Check, Require, or Run choice; setup approval may override it for the ticket run. Integration refreshes drift evidence and applies the approved advisory, required, or native-hook behavior.
12. During all non-terminal execution states, runtime projections and execution logs are updated so a restarted backend or reloaded browser can restore the ticket from durable state rather than from memory.

See [Beads & Execution](beads.md).

## 7. Recovery Flow

Recovery is a first-class architectural concern.

| Failure type | Recovery strategy |
| --- | --- |
| Browser reload, close, or reconnect gap | REST state remains canonical; the browser keeps the last SSE event id, restores best-effort log cache detail, replays buffered live events, and then refetches tickets, artifacts, bead state, interview state, and matching server logs |
| Frontend crash or tab close | Interview drafts, approval drafts, and browser-cached logs are persisted locally and flushed on unload with best-effort keepalive behavior |
| Concurrent/stale autosave | Server serializes each ticket/scope and compare-and-set rejects revision conflicts with the latest state; Manual QA keeps its five-second debounce/unload keepalive and derives its last-save age/exact timestamp from acknowledged saves |
| Crash during atomic write or append | Startup promotes orphan `.tmp` files, repairs trailing corrupt JSONL lines when safe, and rebuilds runtime projections |
| Invalid model output | Retry with repair or explicit re-prompt, depending on phase |
| Bead execution deadline | Append a Failed Iteration Note, reset worktree, abandon the session, and retry in fresh context |
| OpenCode reconnect gap | Validate the exact project-local owned session against the remote session; preserve all centrally classified blocked-error continuations and all temporarily unverifiable records, and abandon only confirmed-missing or stale ownership |
| Backend process restart | Reconcile persisted XState snapshots, hydrate ticket actors from durable ticket state, and immediately process restored active snapshots. Drafting setup plans consume a durable regeneration request exactly once rather than duplicating or losing a generation. An interrupted coding attempt without a preserved continuation or current finalization checkpoint consumes a Failed Iteration Note, resets safely, advances its iteration, and receives a fresh configured deadline |
| User edits approved interview or PRD | Archive the active approved generation and downstream attempts, cancel downstream sessions intentionally, clear stale downstream artifacts/UI state, persist a `user_edit_receipt:*`, and restart from the next drafting phase |
| User edits or regenerates setup plan during runtime setup | Stop active runtime setup, archive the relevant setup-plan/runtime attempts, preserve the tool cache when safe, and clear stale outputs. Editing returns directly to `WAITING_EXECUTION_SETUP_APPROVAL`; regeneration persists the baseline/commentary and enters `GENERATING_EXECUTION_SETUP_PLAN` before fresh approval |
| User retries setup with a note after the automatic budget ends | Keep the failed runtime phase attempt and its OpenCode session, send only the user's note to that session, and allow one manual setup attempt beyond the configured budget |
| User edits the setup plan after a runtime setup block | Ask for confirmation, then archive the failed runtime attempt, return directly to `WAITING_EXECUTION_SETUP_APPROVAL`, and preserve the failed attempt for review. A later Regenerate action enters the drafting status and supplies its cleaned failure |
| Stale approval | Return `409` with the expected and current SHA-256 hashes, keeping the ticket at the approval gate |
| Manual QA generation/submission restart | Reuse the reserved checklist version or submission operation journal; deterministic action/origin/bead IDs prevent duplicate child work |
| Application-created drift during QA | Stay in `WAITING_MANUAL_QA` and require include/discard for exactly audited paths before submit/skip |
| Bead finalization failure | Append a concise Finalization Failure Note, keep the bead retryable, avoid `bead_complete`, send `BEAD_ERROR` with `BEAD_FINALIZATION_FAILED`, and route to manual `BLOCKED_ERROR` recovery |
| Cleanup warning | Persist a `cleanup_report` with `status: warning`, expose the cleanup summary on the ticket, and still complete the ticket |
| Terminal blockage | Enter `BLOCKED_ERROR` with persisted error occurrence history |

LoopTroop tries hard to preserve the work product while discarding the bad conversational state that produced the failure.

If a resume point cannot be proven, recovery stops at `BLOCKED_ERROR` instead of continuing execution against unknown state. `BLOCKED_ERROR` retry requires a preserved `previousStatus`; `CODING` retry also requires a successful reset to the failed bead's `beadStartCommit`. For a live block from `PREPARING_EXECUTION_ENV`, **Retry with extra note...** sends only the entered text to the preserved setup session and grants one manual attempt beyond the automatic retry budget. It does not archive the runtime phase attempt or add the note to later setup context. **Edit setup plan...** asks for confirmation before it archives the runtime attempt and rewinds to setup-plan approval. Errors shown in summaries and cards are cleaned of ANSI and other terminal control sequences, decoration-only lines, carriage-return artifacts, and consecutive duplicate warnings. Raw logs stay unchanged.

## 8. Restart And Session Ownership

LoopTroop pairs persisted ticket snapshots with OpenCode session ownership records so it can decide whether a remote session still belongs to the exact workflow slot that wants to use it.

Ownership keys can include:

- `ticketId`
- `phase`
- `phaseAttempt`
- `memberId`
- `beadId`
- `iteration`
- `step`

This lets LoopTroop safely reconnect in cases like:

- server restart while a ticket is still in the same phase
- phase retry that should resume the currently owned session
- multi-model council phases where each member has its own session identity
- bead execution where iteration and bead identity both matter

Reconnect deliberately does **not** mean "resume any random old transcript." Validation succeeds only if the ticket is still in the same workflow state, the project database still records that ownership slot as active, and the exact remote session still exists.

Snapshot restore is equally defensive. `server/machines/persistence.ts` reconciles persisted XState snapshots with the ticket row; if the snapshot is missing required structure, cannot be reconciled, or would resume from an unprovable state, the ticket is rebuilt conservatively or moved to `BLOCKED_ERROR` instead of guessing.

Prompt acquisition is bounded by timeout and abort signals. OpenCode `create`, `list`, `getSession`, and message-read calls are guarded so an OpenCode restart cannot indefinitely block the workflow runner.

## 12. Startup State System

On startup, LoopTroop restores durable state through `server/startup.ts` and `server/startupState.ts`. The workflow runner hydrates ticket actors from the project database, and the OpenCode layer attempts to reconnect only sessions that still match a valid ownership record.

### Bootstrap Sequence

`startupSequence()` performs the runtime bootstrap in this order:

1. Initialize the app/project databases and create runtime indexes.
2. Classify the startup storage state and capture runtime diagnostics such as WSL mounted-drive warnings.
3. Recover ticket runtime artifacts by promoting orphan `.tmp` files, repairing trailing JSONL corruption where safe, and rebuilding `.ticket/runtime/state.yaml` projections.
4. Start the WAL checkpoint timer and probe OpenCode health.
5. Hydrate XState actors for non-terminal tickets from attached project databases.
6. Validate and reconnect active OpenCode sessions using project-local ticket identity. Eligible blocked-error continuations are matched through their unresolved occurrence, previous phase, and exact diagnostic session id; transiently unverifiable records remain active, while confirmed-missing or stale records are marked abandoned.

### Startup Classification

`classifyStartupStorageKind()` determines the current storage condition:

| Kind | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `fresh` | First-ever startup — no prior app database exists. |
| `empty_existing` | App database exists but has no attached projects. |
| `restored` | Database found with existing projects — full state restoration. |

### Restore Flow

1. `initializeStartupState()` reads the app database path, profile count, and attached project count, then persists the startup classification.
2. `getStartupStatus()` exposes the cached startup snapshot through `GET /api/health/startup`.
3. The frontend uses `useStartupStatus()` and `StartupRestorePopup` to show restore context after a real restore.
4. `dismissStartupRestoreNotice()` persists the user's dismissal in app metadata so the restore notice does not keep reappearing.

Session recovery is best-effort. If OpenCode is unavailable during startup, ticket actors are still hydrated from durable workflow state and active session records remain preserved for later verification. Later phase work either reconnects, creates fresh owned sessions where appropriate, or blocks with a persisted error; a temporary startup outage cannot by itself remove an eligible Continue action.

The startup health endpoint exposes the storage path, kind, source, runtime warning state, restored project list, dismissed state, and human-readable summary for diagnostics and UI messaging.

## 13. IO Utilities

The IO layer provides crash-safe file operations and recovery used by the workflow engine. All modules live in `server/io/`.

| Module | Purpose | Key Export |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `atomicWrite.ts` | Crash-safe file writes | `safeAtomicWrite(filePath, content)` — writes to a `.tmp` file, calls `fsync`, renames to the target path, then best-effort fsyncs the parent directory. Prevents partial overwrites on system failure. |
| `atomicAppend.ts` | Crash-safe line appends | `safeAtomicAppend(filePath, line)` — opens with the `a+` flag, checks trailing newline, adds a `\n` prefix when needed, then calls `fsync`. Used for durable JSONL log appends. |
| `jsonl.ts` | JSON Lines I/O | `readJsonl<T>()`, `writeJsonl<T>()`, `appendJsonl<T>()` — type-safe JSONL read/write/append with graceful malformed-line skipping and newline integrity. |
| `recovery.ts` | Crash recovery | `recoverOrphanTmpFiles(folder)` — recursively promotes `.tmp` files to their target paths after a crash; `fixTrailingLineCorruption(filePath)` — validates and truncates trailing corrupt JSONL lines (scans backward in 8KB chunks, stays under 4MB scan limit). |

These utilities form the durability backbone: atomic writes protect mutable state files (YAML and JSON artifacts), atomic appends protect append-only logs, and recovery handles the edge case where a process stops mid-write.

## 14. Session Status Logging

OpenCode session status events are translated into normalized log entries by `server/workflow/sessionStatusLogging.ts`. Each entry captures a retry event or phase change as a structured execution-log record so live SSE views and reload-time log reads converge on the same timeline.

`buildSessionStatusLogEntries()` converts OpenCode `SessionStatusStreamEvent` objects into `SessionStatusLogEntry[]` — ordered, typed log entries with:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Stable entry identifier |
| `type` | `info` or `error` |
| `kind` | `session` or `error` |
| `op` | `append`, `upsert`, or `finalize` — determines how the log viewer merges this entry |
| `content` | Human-readable description of the status event |

The log builder handles retry status events (rate limits, usage limits, timeouts, transport errors) and session phase transitions. These entries feed the normal execution log alongside phase log entries, while the separate AI-detail log keeps prompt/tool-call depth when that channel is needed.

## 15. Optional Manual QA Architecture And Cross-Application Impact

Manual QA is a ticket-locked branch of the execution band, not a browser-only form. Configuration resolves ticket → project → profile on Start and stores both the effective boolean and source. The public ticket read model adds `visitedStatuses`, monotonic `workflowRevision`, and a compact Manual QA projection so polling, SSE, the navigator, status summaries, completed review, and needs-input attention agree even when a failed round moves backward to Coding.

The backend domain under `server/phases/manualQa/*` owns strict schemas, PRD ref/coverage validation, version reservation, checkpoint/baseline and drift audits, contained streaming evidence, checklist generation, submission journaling, child-ticket provenance, and AI-assisted QA-bead planning. Canonical files live under `.ticket/manual-qa/vN/`; compact phase artifacts support indexed UI/history queries, while binary evidence remains filesystem-only. The round index exposes structured checklist availability/outcome/completion/phase-attempt entries so reservation-only rounds are not treated as artifacts. Status titles remain stable and version-free, and the standard selector appears only when multiple checklist-backed rounds exist. The generic UI-state channel is server-revisioned CAS storage, and `manual_qa_draft:vN` is the only live draft.

The candidate checkpoint is the boundary between final tests and user verification. Accepted candidate effects are committed locally through exact-file staging, while untracked generated, cache, and setup-local outputs remain usable in the worktree and are excluded from totals, checkpoints, and delivery. The saved delivery baseline still detects application-created drift before submit/skip. This design affects final-test classification, Git integration/squashing, candidate exclusions, and the first subsequent QA-fix commit without requiring a completely empty worktree.

Submission stages immutable results and its operation journal first. For failed merge groups, one main-implementer prompt receives focused ticket/PRD/bead/final-test/checklist/evidence/diff context and must complete at least one successful read-only repository inspection. Strict parsing validates complete normal-bead fields, safe project-relative targets, references, dependencies, and exact merge-group coverage. The full candidate set is persisted to `fix-beads.yaml` before any child side effect; only then are Improvement tickets created and application-owned IDs/lifecycle metadata applied to normal `qa-fix` beads. Generation/tool/parser failure therefore creates no child records, moves the ticket to recoverable `BLOCKED_ERROR`, and Retry resumes the exact action. Improvements retain the chosen P1–P5 priority and explicit Manual QA setting. Advisory PRD coverage includes reasoned `not_applicable` criteria, and the selected-version phase log is collapsed by default.

This adds one model session and focused read-only tool activity to failed Manual QA submission, increasing failure-submit latency and model usage. Downstream scheduling, coding, metrics, commit, final-test, integration, and delivery consumers still receive normal bead records; typed `qaOrigin` remains supplemental provenance. The change deliberately does not migrate or repair pre-existing testing tickets or Manual QA artifacts.

OpenCode prompt transport now supports SDK text/system/file parts. A QA-fix bead attaches every detected image evidence file when its locked model advertises image input; other evidence remains referenced. Missing capability records `references_only`, and provider/context overflow routes through ordinary bead error recovery without silently altering the selected evidence set.

Security boundaries are local-content containment rather than file-type trust: each upload is streamed, capped at 250 MiB per file, hash/size verified, name-sanitized, symlink/traversal checked, and atomically renamed. There is no count/round-total cap. The client publishes acknowledged uploads into the current item immediately, renders link Details only after Add link is chosen, and limits the initial evidence disclosure to five entries. Only safe raster types may be inline; everything else is `nosniff` attachment content. LoopTroop never launches, previews, stops, or controls the application under test.
